### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: Are Americans Who Concerned About Economy Concerned About Covid-19?
+ This project is conducted by Mengyao He

+ Project summary: Many people believe that most Americans are worried more worried about economy than Covid-19. Does this means those people are not concerned about the risk of Covid-19? In this analysis, I used [ANES 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey dataset](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-exploratory-testing-survey/) from American National Election Studies (ANES). From the results I get, it showed that Americans who very worried about the Economy are worried about the Covid-19.
